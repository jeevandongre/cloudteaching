&index_title1=About  Project
&index_txt1=<b>This project is mainly based on CLOUD COMPUTING:</b><br />		Cloud computing describes a data-processing infrastructure in which <br>the application software and often the data itself is stored permanently not <br>on your PC but rather a remote server that is connected to the Internet. <br>		When you need to use the application or access the data, your computer connects to the server through the Internet and some of that information is cached temporarily on your client machine. What do clouds have to do with all this? The cloud is simply a metaphor for the Internet, based on the symbol that is used to represent the worldwide network in computer network diagrams. &

&page1_txt2=<b>This PROJECT intends to develop an end-to-end Cloud Based Teaching System</b><br />A cloud based teaching system harnesses variety of cloud resources to design develop and deploy teaching courses and delivers them over the web. &

&page1_readmore_title1=READ MORE

&page1_readmore_txt1=	By end-to-end the CLOUD BASED TEACHING SYSTEM covers all aspect of teaching process such as Course registration, content delivery, monitoring of students progress, assignments, tests and final certification culminating with warding grades to registered students. 
	The CLOUD BASED TEACHING SYSTEM will be accessible to teacher and students at a web-interface and acts as a dashboard.
	We have available today the tools and resources needed for the successful practice of cloud- based teaching-learning system. By cloud-based teaching-learning system we mean a method of teaching where web is the point of contact between teacher and learner. This system may be used independently or in conjunction with class room teaching.

&page1_readmore_txt2=Cloud computing is Internet- based development and use of computer technology ("computing"). In concept, it is a paradigm shift whereby details are abstracted from the users who no longer need knowledge of, expertise in, or control over the technology infrastructure "in the cloud" that supports them. It typically involves the provision of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources as a service over the Internet.
The term cloud is used as a metaphor for the Internet, based on how the Internet is depicted in computer network diagrams and is an abstraction of the underlying infrastructure it conceals. Typical cloud computing services provide common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser, while the software and data are stored on the servers. These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

&second_title1=Application Programming Interface
&page2_txt1=<b>An Application-Programming Interface (API) is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application or Web tool.</b><br />An API is an abstraction that describes an interface for the interaction with a set of functions used by components of a software system. <br /><br />&
&page2_txt2=<b>"Web API" is virtually a synonym for web service</b><br />When used in the context of web development, an API is typically a defined set of Hypertext Transfer Protocol  request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is usually in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.  The recent trend  has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based services towards more direct Representational State Transfer.&

&page2_readmore_title1=Second Page ReadMore Title #1

&page2_readmore_txt1=An Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface implemented by a software program which enables it to interact with other software. It is similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers. An API is implemented by applications, libraries, and operating systems to determine their vocabularies and calling conventions, and is used to access their services. It may include specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and protocols used to communicate between the consumer and the implementer of the API.

&page2_readmore_txt2=<b>Use of APIs to share content</b>:
The practice of publishing APIs has allowed web communities to create an open architecture for sharing content and data between communities and applications. In this way, content that is created in one place can be dynamically posted and updated in multiple locations on the web.
   1. Photos can be shared from sites like Flickr and Photobucket to social network sites like Facebook and MySpace.
   2. Content can be embedded, e.g. embedding a presentation from SlideShare on a LinkedIn profile.
   3. Content can be dynamically posted. Sharing live comments made on Twitter with a Facebook account, for example, is enabled by their APIs.
   4. Video content can be embedded on sites which are served by another host.
   5. User information can be shared from web communities to outside applications, delivering new functionality to the web community that shares its user data via an open API. One of the best examples of this is the Facebook Application platform. Another is the Open Social platform.&

&third_title1=Google App Engine
&page3_txt1=<b>Google App Engine lets us run your web applications on Google's infrastructure.</b><br /> With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain: You just upload the application, and it's ready to serve users. App Engine applications are easy to build, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as our traffic and data storage needs grow.& 


&third_txt1=<b>App Engine includes the following features:</b><br><br>• Dynamic web serving, with full support for common web technologies.
• Persistent storage with queries, sorting and transactions.
• Automatic scaling and load balancing.
• APIs for authenticating users and sending email using Google Accounts.
• A fully featured local development environment that simulates Google App Engine on
your computer.
• Task queues for performing work outside of the scope of a web request.
• Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times and regular intervals.</a></font><br /><br />

&page3_readmore_title1=Third Page ReadMore Title #1

&page3_readmore_txt1=
Google App Engine supports apps written in several programming languages. With App Engine's Java runtime environment, you can build your app using standard Java technologies, including the JVM, Java servlets, and the Java programming language or any other language using a JVM-based interpreter or compiler, such as JavaScript or Ruby. 
App Engine also features a dedicated Python runtime environment, which includes a fast Python interpreter and the Python standard library. 
The Java and Python runtime environments are built to ensure that your application runs quickly, securely, and without interference from other apps on the system.

&fourth_title1=Eclipse
&fourth_txt1=<b>Eclipse is a multi-language software development environment comprising an integrated development environment (IDE) and an extensible plug-in system</b><br /> .

&fourth_title2=Architecture:
 
&fourth_txt2=Eclipse employs plug-ins in order to provide all of its functionality on top of (and including) the runtime system, in contrast to some other applications where functionality is typically hard coded. The runtime system of Eclipse is based on Equinox, an OSGi standard compliant implementation.


&page4_readmore1=READ MORE


&page4_readmore_title1=Fourth Page ReadMore Title #1

&page4_readmore_txt1=It is written primarily in Java and can be used to develop applications in Java and, by means of the various plug-ins, in other languages as well, including C, C++, COBOL, Python, Perl, PHP, and others. 
The IDE is often called Eclipse ADT for Ada, Eclipse CDT for C/C++, Eclipse JDT for Java and Eclipse PDT for PHP.

&page4_readmore_txt2=The Eclipse 3.5 release endgame involves a sequence of test/fix passes leading to the official 3.5 release. Even more than at other times, we welcome all the help we can get with testing and fixing the various Eclipse release candidates. To participate effectively everyone needs to track this schedule closely so that we end up testing the latest release candidate and entering bugzilla bug reports in time to be considered for the fix pass that immediately follows, giving rise to the next release candidate. Throughout the process, we are most concerned with "stop ship" (P1) bugs that must be fixed before we can declare that we have a release. If we discover a "stop ship" bug late in the process, we may have to slip the schedule to allow it to be fixed and retested. This is why it is so important to ferret out "stop ship" bugs as early as possible, while there is still time left in the schedule to address them. Most of the bugs that will be uncovered will be less serious
